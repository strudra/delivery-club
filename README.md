# Delivery Club
This is an ongoing project for the Software Project course for Second Year Bachelor course on Innopolis University. 
If completed successfully, this app is aimed to be used at city of Innopolis to make the life of people in Innopolis easier, 
by making the delivery of food easier, secure, faster and reliable.

# Delivery Club Frontend
This is only the frontend part of the project. 
To find the backend of this project you can go to: https://github.com/strudra/delivery-club-api

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
  ## Prerequisites
  In order to develop and/or test this project you will need to install several dependencies:
  1. Install Expo CLI utility: `npm install -g expo-cli`
  2. Run `yarn install` in the root directory of the project to fetch and install other dependencies, after that you should be able to run the project
  3. Install Expo Client application from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) or [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)
  ## Running
  To start the environment, you need to run `expo start` in the project directory, a window will open in your browser. Then use Expo Client on one of your mobile devices to connect to the Expo environment. I suggest choosing LAN on the dashboard page, since it's the fastest way, you will have to be on the same Wi-Fi network though.
  ## Language & Tools
  For the frontend, we have used Expo, React-Native framework with javascript and Native-Base CSS library for UI design.
